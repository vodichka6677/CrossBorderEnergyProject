# Cross-Border Renewable Energy Simulation

## Project Overview
This MATLAB project simulates solar and wind energy production in Kazakhstan and China over a 30-day period. It models cross-border energy transmission, accounting for line efficiency and daily fluctuations.

## Objectives
- Analyze renewable energy generation patterns in Kazakhstan and China.
- Simulate energy transmission from Kazakhstan to China, including losses.
- Visualize energy data using plots and heatmaps.

## Method
- Generated daily solar and wind energy data for both regions with Â±10% random variation.
- Calculated total energy in China, including transmitted energy from Kazakhstan.
- Visualized results with:
  - Line plots for solar, wind, and total energy.
  - Heatmap showing energy transmission efficiency.

## Results
- Daily solar and wind energy production for both regions.
- Total energy in China including transmitted energy.
- Heatmap illustrating energy flow and transmission efficiency.

## Skills Applied
- MATLAB programming
- Data visualization
- Engineering modeling and simulation
- Problem-solving and analytical thinking
